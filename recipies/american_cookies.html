    <h4> Better than Subways' try not to melt when you eat </h4>
    <p> These cookies are as big as they are soft and chewy, trust me when I say they outrank Subzays' cookies .</p>
    <p> However unlike the pancakes be careful how much you eat as they are fat as f*ck, so don't cry after finishing the whole plate  (I warned you, so you can't blame me)  </p>
    <p> Respecting the quantities in the recipe is important if you zant to have the right texture of cookie, but you can reduce the sugar if you care about your health (shoutout to the gym bros)</p>

    <h4> Ingredients </h4>
    <p>Here is the recipe for 6 people. If you want more just do the math as for the moment I didn't learn to embed code in a website hehe</p>
    <ul> 
        <li>200g of Nestle Dark chocolate (the main character of this recipe) </li>
        <li>1 Egg</li>
        <li>220g of Flour</li>
        <li>185g of Brown Sugar (if you want to feel better with your belly just put half of it)</li>
        <li>15g of White Sugar (don't ask me why not only brown, just do as you want)</li>
        <li>1 teaspon of Vanilla Powder</li>
        <li>1/2 a teaspon of Baking Powder</li>

        <li>Pre-Heat the oven at 140 degrees Celcius </li>

        <li>In another bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, baking soda, the salt, and the vanilla powder</li>
        <li>Add the previous mixture to the first one and mix to obtain something smicky enough to use your hands</li>
        <li>Add 1/3 of the chocolate chips</li>
        <li>Make rounds of mixture and dispose them distantly from each others</li>
        <li>Add the rest of the chocolate chips on the cookies</li>
        <li> Put it in the oven for 15 minutes. NOT MORE : they shouldn't look cooked and it's nornal </li>
        <li> Finally, let them cool. During the process the soft cookies will get hard</li>
        <li> Enjoy your cookies</li>
